ETooL

 
The application is an implementation of a tool to perform an ETL process and <br> 
load processed data into a data warehouse.

Application is written in java and allows extracting from many source formats <br> 
e.g. .txt, .xml, .csv, .json, as well as databases e.g. oracle database, postgresql and mongodb.

To keep up to date on the issues I'm working on, feel free to take a look [Trello](https://trello.com/b/JbveP8fi/etool).

Currently, the application is reading data from types: txt, csv, json, xml and from postgresql database and loading it into json format repository.

We run the application using the AppRunner class.
