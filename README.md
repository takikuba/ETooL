ETooL

ETooL application written as part of an engineering thesis.  
The application is an implementation of a tool to perform an ETL process and <br> 
load processed data into a data warehouse.

Application is written in java and allows extracting from many source formats <br> 
e.g. .txt, .xml, .csv, .json, as well as databases e.g. oracle database, postgresql and mongodb.
